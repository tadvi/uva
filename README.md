# uva - solutions, examples and experiments

UVa Online Judge is an online automated judge for programming problems hosted by University of Valladolid. Its problem archive has over 4300 problems.

**sample** subfolders contain solutions collected elsewhere. They are assumed to be correct.

This repo is used for algorithm analysis, study and experimentation. My experiments are in **main.go** files in main subfolders. At the time of this writing in 2018 UVa does not have online automated judge for Go language. Therefore my solutions have no independent verification.
