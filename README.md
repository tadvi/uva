# uva - solutions, examples and experiments

UVa Online Judge is an online automated judge for programming problems hosted by University of Valladolid. Its problem archive has over 4300 problems.

**sample** subfolders contain solutions collected elsewhere. They are assumed to be correct.

This repo is used for algorithm analysis, study and experimentation.
My experiments are in **main.go** or **main.py** files in main subfolders.

Many study experiments are just copied and re-coded versions of solutions from **sample** subfolders.

EXPERIMENTAL repo.
